*10 ways to have better conversation*
- Don't Multitask(Be fully into the conversation)

- Use open ended question(Like questions to know how it affected them or how they felt,why they felt what they did for which the answer is not a one word)
- Go with the flow (Don't deviate from listening)
- If u don't know say u don't know

- Try not to repeat yourself 
- Don't include specific dates,years or random shitt .They don't care really,they only care about ur experience in it.
- Listen(If u're mouth is open u're not learning) Learn to shut the fuck up your mouth.
- Be brief(Like a mini skirt - short enough to not get bored and long enough to convey the subject)
